Example script demonstrating RagMe with local Weaviate vector database.

This script shows how to:
1. Start local Weaviate using Podman
2. Configure RagMe to use local Weaviate
3. Add web pages to the vector database
4. Query the stored content

Prerequisites:
- Podman and Podman Compose installed
- Set VECTOR_DB_TYPE=weaviate-local in your environment
- Start local Weaviate: ./tools/weaviate-local.sh start
