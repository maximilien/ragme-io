# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and their solutions for RAGme AI.

## üö® Common Issues

### Environment Variable Configuration Not Taking Effect

**Problem**: Changing `.env` files (APPLICATION_*, VECTOR_DB_TYPE, collection names) doesn't take effect after restart.

**Symptoms**:
- Application still shows old name/title after switching `.env` files
- Still connecting to old vector database collection
- Environment changes appear ignored

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED!** This was a critical bug that has been resolved. The system now properly reads and applies all environment variable changes:

1. **Verify configuration loading**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/config-validator.sh
   ```

2. **Check environment variables are loaded**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from src.ragme.utils.config_manager import config
   print(f'App name: {config.get(\"application.name\")}')
   print(f'DB type: {config.get(\"vector_databases.default\")}')
   "
   ```

3. **Proper environment switching**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   cp .env.app.viewfinder-ai .env  # or your desired environment
   ./start.sh
   ```

**What was fixed**:
- Environment variable syntax in config.yaml (changed from `{$VAR}` to `${VAR}`)
- Dynamic VECTOR_DB_TYPE selection and mapping
- Proper configuration loading and substitution

### Vector Database Connection Errors

**Problem**: Connection errors when starting services.

**Symptoms**:
```
ConnectionError: Failed to connect to vector database
```

**Solution**: 
1. **For local development**: The system now defaults to Milvus Lite, which doesn't require external services
2. **For Weaviate Cloud**: Ensure your credentials are properly configured in `.env`:
   ```bash
   VECTOR_DB_TYPE=weaviate
   WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   WEAVIATE_URL=https://your-cluster.weaviate.network
   ```
3. **For local Weaviate**: Ensure local Weaviate is running:
   ```bash
   ./tools/weaviate-local.sh status
   ./tools/weaviate-local.sh start
   ```

**Automatic Fallback**: If vector database connection fails, the system will show helpful error messages and guide you to the correct configuration.

**Debugging with VDB Management Tool**: Use the VDB management tool to diagnose vector database issues:

```bash
# Check VDB health and connectivity
./tools/vdb.sh health

# Show current VDB configuration
./tools/vdb.sh --show

# View virtual structure to understand data organization
./tools/vdb.sh virtual-structure

# List collections and their status
./tools/vdb.sh collections --list
```

This tool provides detailed information about:
- Vector database connectivity and health
- Collection status and configuration
- Data structure and organization
- Document and image counts

### Frontend Not Loading

**Problem**: New frontend (default port 8020) is not accessible.

**Symptoms**:
```
Cannot connect to http://localhost:8020
```

**Note**: The frontend port can be customized using the `RAGME_FRONTEND_PORT` environment variable.

**Solution**:
1. **Check if frontend is running**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh status
   ```
2. **Restart frontend only**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh restart-frontend
   ```
3. **Check frontend logs**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/tail-logs.sh frontend
   ```
4. **Rebuild frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Safari Browser Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: RAGme interface does not load or function properly in Safari browser.

**Symptoms**:
- UI appears blank or partially loaded
- Console shows "Failed to load resource" errors
- SSL errors for localhost resources
- "Load failed" errors for all API requests
- Content Security Policy (CSP) violations

**Root Cause**: Safari has very strict security policies for localhost development:
- **HTTPS Upgrade**: Safari automatically upgrades `http://localhost` to `https://localhost`
- **Localhost Restrictions**: Safari blocks many HTTP requests to localhost for security
- **CSP Enforcement**: Strict Content Security Policy enforcement
- **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Aggressive CORS policies for localhost

**Attempted Solutions** (None fully successful):
1. **Port Changes**: Tried ports 8023, 8024 to avoid cached HTTPS redirects
2. **IP Address**: Attempted using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
3. **XMLHttpRequest**: Switched from `fetch()` to `XMLHttpRequest`
4. **Dynamic Resource Loading**: Programmatic CSS/JS loading with explicit HTTP URLs
5. **CSP Modifications**: Updated Content Security Policy headers
6. **Self-Contained Versions**: Created inline CSS/JS versions

**Current Status**: ‚ùå **Safari compatibility not achieved**

**Workarounds**:
1. **Use Alternative Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge work perfectly with RAGme
2. **Safari Settings** (may help in some cases):
   - Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking"
   - Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Check "Show Develop menu"
   - Safari ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions
   - Try Private Browsing mode
3. **Development Environment**: Use Chrome/Firefox for development, Safari for testing only

**Technical Details**:
- Safari's localhost security is fundamentally incompatible with typical development setups
- The browser enforces strict HTTPS requirements even for local development
- Network requests to localhost are heavily restricted regardless of method used
- This is a known Safari limitation, not a RAGme-specific issue

**Recommendation**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for the best RAGme experience. Safari compatibility may be addressed in future versions with different architectural approaches.



### ResourceWarning: unclosed file

**Problem**: `ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.TextIOWrapper name=0 mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>`

**Solution**: This warning has been suppressed in the codebase. The warning was caused by temporary file handles in the MCP server, which are now properly managed.

### Milvus Deprecation Warnings

**Problem**: Deprecation warnings from pkg_resources in Milvus Lite.

**Symptoms**:
```
DeprecationWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API
```

**Solution**: This is a known issue with Milvus Lite dependencies. The warning is harmless and doesn't affect functionality. It will be resolved in future versions of Milvus Lite.

### API Server Not Responding

**Problem**: API server (default port 8021) is not responding to requests.

**Symptoms**:
```
Connection refused on port 8021
```

**Note**: The API port can be customized using the `RAGME_API_PORT` environment variable.

**Solution**:
1. **Check API server status**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh status
   ```
2. **Restart API server**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh restart
   ```
3. **Check API logs**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/tail-logs.sh api
   ```
4. **Test API endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl --max-time 10 http://localhost:8021/docs
   ```

### MCP Server Issues

**Problem**: MCP server (default port 8022) is not processing documents.

**Note**: The MCP port can be customized using the `RAGME_MCP_PORT` environment variable.

**Symptoms**:
```
MCP server not responding
Document processing failures
```

**Solution**:
1. **Check MCP server status**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh status
   ```
2. **Restart MCP server**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh restart
   ```
3. **Check MCP logs**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/tail-logs.sh mcp
   ```
4. **Test MCP endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl --max-time 10 http://localhost:8022/docs
   ```

### File Monitoring Not Working

**Problem**: Files placed in `watch_directory/` are not being processed.

**Symptoms**:
```
New files not detected
No automatic processing
```

**Solution**:
1. **Check if file monitor is running**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh status
   ```
2. **Restart file monitor**:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh restart
   ```
3. **Check agent logs**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/tail-logs.sh agent
   ```
4. **Verify file permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la watch_directory/
   ```

## üöÄ Performance Issues

### Slow Startup

**Problem**: Services take a long time to start.

**Causes**:
- Large vector database
- Network connectivity issues
- Resource constraints
- Frontend build process

**Solutions**:
1. Use local Milvus instead of cloud Weaviate
2. Check network connectivity
3. Monitor system resources
4. Pre-build frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`

### Memory Usage

**Problem**: High memory usage during operation.

**Solutions**:
1. Monitor with `./stop.sh status`
2. Restart services periodically
3. Consider using smaller vector dimensions
4. Check for memory leaks in long-running processes

### Frontend Performance

**Problem**: Frontend is slow or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Check WebSocket connection** in browser dev tools
4. **Monitor frontend logs**: `./tools/tail-logs.sh frontend`
5. **Restart frontend**: `./start.sh restart-frontend`
