# TODOs

## **OPENED**

### bugs
* queries for functional agent are not flowing to function / tool, e.g., "list", "list docs"

* add memory to chat agent
* make sure to confirm with user before executing delete docs tools 

* URL link in chat responses is incorrect when fetching from URL documents
* chat responses and document details card include file or URK links but they do not work (need doc backend for PDFs and others) and use URL as link for URL docs
* when searching for "who is maximilien" with maximilien.org URL and ragme-ai.pdf the response header URL is incorrect but the rest of response is OK: 

```md
Based on the stored documents, here's what I found:

URL: file://ragme-ai.pdf#20250805_100725_984382 (Chunked document with 9 chunks)

Answer: Based on the documents provided, there is no specific information regarding an individual named "Maximilien" that can be definitively identified.

However, one of the documents (Document 2)...
```

### bugs - mobile
* right pane shows as purple block when collapse on mobile (iPhone)

## **COMPLETED**

### features

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Make RAGme work with configurable collection name(s) and LLMs, and MCP servers [Comprehensive configuration system implemented with config.yaml supporting multiple vector databases (Weaviate local/cloud, Milvus local/cloud), configurable LLM models for different agents, MCP server configurations, and complete environment variable support]

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Make other active parts of RAGme that could be changed configurable (e.g., name, query agent) [Full application generalization implemented: configurable app name/title/description, network ports, frontend UI settings, client branding, feature flags, security settings, and all agent configurations. Includes config validation tool and comprehensive documentation]

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Add compile-frontend command to start.sh script [Added `./start.sh compile-frontend` command to easily recompile frontend TypeScript after configuration or code changes, without needing to restart the server. Includes helpful usage documentation and examples.]

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Move test-integration.sh to tools directory for better organization [Organizational improvement to consolidate all utility scripts in tools/ directory, updated all references in documentation and test scripts]

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - README and other docs seems to have repetitions

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Adding large PDF doc via + Add Content seem to cause new doc to not be queryable. Implement semantic search

**Root Cause**: The querying mechanism was using simple keyword matching instead of proper vector similarity search, and the FunctionAgent was not properly executing function calls, returning function call text instead of actual results.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Added proper vector search method**: Implemented `search()` method in all vector database implementations (Weaviate, Weaviate Local, and Milvus) that uses proper vector similarity search
2. **Always use query_agent with fallback**: Modified `ragme_agent.py` to always use the query_agent function first, with fallback to direct vector search
3. **Fixed FunctionAgent execution**: Updated the `run` method to properly handle `ToolOutput` objects from LlamaIndex FunctionTools
4. **LLM summarization of chunks**: Added `_summarize_chunks_with_llm()` method that uses the LLM to generate coherent summaries of relevant chunks instead of showing raw text
5. **Enhanced response quality**: Now provides well-structured, contextual summaries that directly answer the user's query
6. **Added fallback mechanism**: If LLM summarization fails, falls back to raw content for robustness

**Key Improvements**:
- **Semantic search**: Uses proper vector similarity search instead of keyword matching
- **LLM summarization**: Chunks are summarized by the LLM in the context of the user's query
- **Better UX**: Responses are coherent, well-structured, and directly answer the question
- **Robust fallbacks**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure the system always works

**Testing**: Verified that large PDF files like `2506.18511v1.pdf` (83 chunks) now return excellent, coherent summaries for queries like "what do you know about RAG-based framework" and "what is Standard Applicability Judgment".

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - AI summary regeneration during periodic refresh when popup is open

**Root Cause**: When the document details popup was open and periodic document refresh occurred, the `renderDocuments()` method would recreate document cards with new click handlers, causing `showDocumentDetails()` to be called again, which triggered `fetchDocumentSummary()` again, leading to the stuck "Still generating summary..." message.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Modal State Tracking**: Added `documentDetailsModal` object to track modal state, current document ID, and summary generation status
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Check if the same document is already open before generating AI summary
3. **Summary Generation Tracking**: Mark summary as generated to prevent regeneration for the same document
4. **Modal State Reset**: Reset modal state when popup is closed (via close button, overlay click, or escape key)
5. **Render Prevention**: Skip document rendering when modal is open to prevent interference
6. **Request Deduplication**: Added `summaryInProgress` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous summary requests

**Key Improvements**:
- **Prevents Duplicate Summaries**: AI summary is only generated once per document session
- **Better UX**: No more stuck "Still generating summary..." messages
- **State Management**: Proper tracking of modal state and document sessions
- **Clean Reset**: Modal state is properly reset when closed
- **Render Interference Prevention**: Document list rendering is skipped when modal is open
- **Timeout Management**: Proper timeout handling prevents conflicting messages

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Cleanup Function**: Added `cleanup_test_documents()` function that uses the API to identify and delete test documents
2. **API Integration**: Uses the `/list-documents` endpoint to retrieve all documents and `/delete-document/{id}` to remove test documents
