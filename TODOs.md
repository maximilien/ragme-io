# TODOs

## **OPENED**

### bugs
* query agent should perform user query (not necessarily summarize results from semantic search)
* queries for functional agent are not flowing to function / tool, e.g., "list", "list docs"
* make sure to confirm with user before executing delete docs tools 
* add memory to chat agent
* chat responses and document details card include file link but does not work (need doc backend)
* right pane shows as purple block when collapse on mobile (iPhone)
* the chat text input is hidden on mobile (iPhone). Need to flip to horizontal and touch bottom to be able to make text input visible and usable

### frontend
* settings to enable / disable saving uploaded documents in doc server
* doc details card should allow viewing of doc and chunks

### backend
* document server - for documents added with "+ Add Content" upload keep copy on doc server. Add settings to enable / disable this
* MCP tool servers integration and authentication
* MCP agent to call and use MCP server tools depending on prompts
* gateway agent and prompt tuning to figure out if user prompt should be handled by Query / Function / MCP agent
* graph db - build knowledge graph of documents / content via Neo4J
* graph agent - queries graph db with text -> cypher query to complement query agent results

### tests
* test with local weaviate 
* test with local milvus

### features

#### generalization 
* make RAGme work with configurable collection name
* make other parts of RAGme that could be changed, e.g., name, query agent configurable

#### use cases
* support agent to collect images and docs for period of time and create report, e.g., conference slide photos

#### content types
* images - add images from URLs and upload
* support extracting metadata from images
* support extracting text from images and add to metadata, eg, image of a slide
* extract images from documents and upload to ImagesDocs collection with metadata to link back to document 
* voice memos - `.wav` files and other formats
* podcasts - link to podcast files
* blogs (RSS) subscriptions - any RSS feed
* videos (YouTube) - link to youtube videos

#### insights
* daily summaries - create a summary of a particular day's activity
* daily insights - generate insight from documents added in a particular day
* monthly versions - monthly versions of summaries and insights

#### services (MCP servers)
* mail - gmail support to read / write mails
* todos - google task read / write
* cloud drives - google drive / microsoft one drive/ dropbox
* twillio (phone messages) - add documents and links using messages with a phone number
* whatsapp integration (explore if possible)
* slack channels - add documents and links using slack messages
* X / Twitter - add documents and links from X account posts

### nice to have
* a2a support to discover and call other external agents to do work

## **COMPLETED**

### bugs
* âœ… **COMPLETED** - README and other docs seems to have repetitions

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - Adding large PDF doc via + Add Content seem to cause new doc to not be queryable. Implement semantic search

**Root Cause**: The querying mechanism was using simple keyword matching instead of proper vector similarity search, and the FunctionAgent was not properly executing function calls, returning function call text instead of actual results.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Added proper vector search method**: Implemented `search()` method in all vector database implementations (Weaviate, Weaviate Local, and Milvus) that uses proper vector similarity search
2. **Always use query_agent with fallback**: Modified `ragme_agent.py` to always use the query_agent function first, with fallback to direct vector search
3. **Fixed FunctionAgent execution**: Updated the `run` method to properly handle `ToolOutput` objects from LlamaIndex FunctionTools
4. **LLM summarization of chunks**: Added `_summarize_chunks_with_llm()` method that uses the LLM to generate coherent summaries of relevant chunks instead of showing raw text
5. **Enhanced response quality**: Now provides well-structured, contextual summaries that directly answer the user's query
6. **Added fallback mechanism**: If LLM summarization fails, falls back to raw content for robustness

**Key Improvements**:
- **Semantic search**: Uses proper vector similarity search instead of keyword matching
- **LLM summarization**: Chunks are summarized by the LLM in the context of the user's query
- **Better UX**: Responses are coherent, well-structured, and directly answer the question
- **Robust fallbacks**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure the system always works

**Testing**: Verified that large PDF files like `2506.18511v1.pdf` (83 chunks) now return excellent, coherent summaries for queries like "what do you know about RAG-based framework" and "what is Standard Applicability Judgment".

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - AI summary regeneration during periodic refresh when popup is open

**Root Cause**: When the document details popup was open and periodic document refresh occurred, the `renderDocuments()` method would recreate document cards with new click handlers, causing `showDocumentDetails()` to be called again, which triggered `fetchDocumentSummary()` again, leading to the stuck "Still generating summary..." message.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Modal State Tracking**: Added `documentDetailsModal` object to track modal state, current document ID, and summary generation status
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Check if the same document is already open before generating AI summary
3. **Summary Generation Tracking**: Mark summary as generated to prevent regeneration for the same document
4. **Modal State Reset**: Reset modal state when popup is closed (via close button, overlay click, or escape key)
5. **Render Prevention**: Skip document rendering when modal is open to prevent interference
6. **Request Deduplication**: Added `summaryInProgress` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous summary requests

**Key Improvements**:
- **Prevents Duplicate Summaries**: AI summary is only generated once per document session
- **Better UX**: No more stuck "Still generating summary..." messages
- **State Management**: Proper tracking of modal state and document sessions
- **Clean Reset**: Modal state is properly reset when closed
- **Render Interference Prevention**: Document list rendering is skipped when modal is open
- **Timeout Management**: Proper timeout handling prevents conflicting messages

* âœ… **COMPLETED** - `test.sh integration` still polluting the RagMeDocs collection with test_integration.pdf -- not cleaning up

**Root Cause**: The cleanup function in `test-integration.sh` was only removing test files from the `watch_directory` but not cleaning up documents that were already added to the vector database collection.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Cleanup Function**: Added `cleanup_test_documents()` function that uses the API to identify and delete test documents
2. **API Integration**: Uses the `/list-documents` endpoint to retrieve all documents and `/delete-document/{id}` to remove test documents
3. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies test documents by looking for patterns like "test_integration", "test.pdf", and "test.*integration" in document metadata
4. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Now cleans up both file system (watch_directory) and vector database (RagMeDocs collection)
5. **Success Tracking**: Provides detailed feedback on cleanup operations with counts of deleted documents

**Key Improvements**:
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removes test documents from both file system and vector database
- **API-Based Deletion**: Uses proper API endpoints to delete documents from the collection
